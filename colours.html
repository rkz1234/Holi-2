        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2><u>The Nasty World Of Chemical Holi Colours</u></h2>
    <p>It is ironic that Holi which is a festival which celebrates nature in all its hues and finery,
         and also the triumph of good over evil, is today largely celebrated with toxic, unhealthy and
          deadly chemicals.<br>

        Industrial dyes are largely used as Holi colours since they are cheaper and often gaudier. The price they extract however on human health and environmental well-being is tremendous. These chemicals were never developed for human use, including Holi colours. Synthetic Holi colours contain cheap, toxic substances which affect human health including mica, acids, alkalis, pieces of glass, etc. The mildest forms of adverse health effects include hair and skin problems like abrasions, irritation, itching, rashes, allergies, eye infections, hair roughness, etc. whilst the more serious forms include poisoning, impaired vision, respiratory problems and cancer. The risks increase when these colours are mixed with oils and fluids and applied to the skin.</p>
        <h3>Pastes</h3>
        <p>The metallic pastes which impart the glistening silver or black or white are tremendously toxic. Here are some of the chemicals one finds in pastes and their effects on human health:</p>
        <table class="table">
        <thead>
        <tr class="text-danger table-primary">
            <th>Colour</th>
            <th>Chemical</th>
            <th>Health effects</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr class="text-success table-info">
            <td>Green</td>
            <td>Copper Sulphate</td>
            <td>Eye Allergy, Puffiness and Temporary blindness</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="text-dark table-danger">
            <td>Black</td>
            <td>Leaf Oxide</td>
            <td>Renal failure</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="text-muted table-success">
            <td>SIlver</td>
            <td>ALuminium Bromide</td>
            <td>Carcinogenic</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="text-muted table-primary">
            <td>BLue</td>
            <td>Prussiun Blue</td>
            <td>Contract Dermatitis</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="text-muted table-dark">
            <td>Red</td>
            <td>Mercury Sulphite</td>
            <td>Highly toxic can cause skin cancer</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3>Water colours</h3>
    <p>One common and easily available water colourant used during Holi is Gentian violet, a highly toxic and hazardous chemical. Exposure to Gentian violet leads to severe skin ailments and eye problems.

        The environmental impact of a toxic, chemical-laced Holi is rarely mentioned. Imagine the damage that tons of heavy metals and toxic chemicals can inflict upon the Earth, polluting our soil and water, and most importantly contaminating it forever.
        
        And now exploiting the fear some people have about using these toxic colours, a new trend of late is to market relatively non-toxic chemical dyes as eco-friendly Holi colours. Whilst these may be safer than the regular chemical colours, they are by no means natural or 100% safe or biodegradable, even when mixed to edible fillers like flours or starch.
        
        If you are now aghast at the idea of playing Holi, there are alternatives. You can make natural Holi colours at home. You can also use completely natural Holi colours such as the ones made by us at Satavic Farms. Our colours are 100% natural, made from herbs, turmeric, agricultural produce, food crops, fruit and vegetable extracts, etc. In fact, since most of the ingredients we use are beneficial, playing Holi with our colours can actually be a healthy experience! Moreover, our packaging is eco-friendly using only bio-degradable materials and is plastic-free.
        
        And for the skeptics, we’ve analysed our colours in a laboratory for heavy metals and chemical dyes.</p>
